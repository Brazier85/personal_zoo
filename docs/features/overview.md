# Feature Overview

My app primarily focuses on two main functions: feeding tracking and event/action management. Please note that this application is not designed for breeding purposes. If you are involved in breeding, there are specialized apps available to cater to those needs.

## Events

In the app's events/actions section, you can conveniently document various occurrences such as medical treatments, shedding, and more. This feature allows you to keep a comprehensive record of important events related to your animals.

## Feedings

With our feeding tracking feature, you can easily monitor and manage your animals' feedings. You have the flexibility to add feedings with specific size and weight measurements, or simply input descriptive text for each feeding.
