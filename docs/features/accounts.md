# Accounts

## Introduction
User login functionality is a pivotal component within numerous applications, including Personal Zoo. This feature empowers registered users to securely access their accounts and undertake diverse actions in accordance with their designated roles and permissions. This marks the inauguration of the initial security-related feature for Personal Zoo.

## Registration
To initiate the account creation process, navigate to `/register.` The first account established during this process automatically attains administrator privileges for the application.

## User Login
Upon successful registration and activation by an administrator, users can conveniently log in to access their respective accounts.

## Security Considerations

Certain features of Personal Zoo are now shielded and accessible only post-login. This ensures that you can showcase your application to others without the concern of unauthorized alterations to your entries.
