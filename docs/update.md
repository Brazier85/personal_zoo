# How to stay up to date?

Being up to date with Personal Zoo is very important. Not only for security reasons (See [security](/security)) but also to be in sync with the latest improvements I made.

To update the application you only have to run `git pull` in your application folder or start the `run_docker.sh`-script.

After the update you should visit the `<host/ip>:5000/update`-page. This page will update your database to the latest changes if there are any.

## Automatic updates

At the current time, my application does not have a auto update function implemented.  But you can find this function on my [roadmap](/roadmap).
