## Why Use Personal Zoo?

Caring for animals often involves more than just feeding them. At my home, we have several reptiles, including pythons and geckos. These animals require meticulous tracking of their feedings, sheddings, weight, and other essential data. As a classic nerd, I wanted an easy-to-use app/web application to manage my family's animals.

I searched for an application tailored to my needs, but I couldn't find one that suited my requirements. Many existing apps are designed for breeding purposes and offer tracking capabilities, but they are often cloud-based and come with subscription fees. I desired a local solution, and that's when I decided to create "Personal Zoo" to bridge this gap.

Personal Zoo is a dedicated web application designed to manage your personal zoo effectively. With its user-friendly interface, you can easily track essential data such as feedings, shedding, weight, and more.

## Introducing Terrarium Management

I understand that reptile habitats, like terrariums, play a crucial role in providing a comfortable environment for your scaly friends. That's why I've added a new feature to Personal Zoo - Terrariums!

With the Terrariums feature, you can keep track of changes, make adjustments to provide the best living conditions for your reptile companions.
