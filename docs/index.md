## Why?

Sometimes taking care of an animal requires more then just feeding it. At my home there are living several reptiles like pythons and geckos. For those animals it is important to keep track of there feedings, moldings, weight, etc. For me personal (a classic nerd) I want to use a App/Webapp to take care of my families animals.

Sadly I did not find the right and easy to use application just for my home. There are great apps out there for keeping track of breeding, etc. Which can also be used to keep track of our feedings, etc.. but they are mostly cloud based and do cost money. I wanted to have something local. So I created "Personal Zoo" to fill this gap. Personal Zoo is a web application to keep track of my (your) personal zoo. It can track **feedings**, **molting**, **weight**, etc...
