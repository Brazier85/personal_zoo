# Security Notice for Personal Zoo

At present, Personal Zoo does not have any implemented security features.

**Please be aware that this is an honest acknowledgement, as the application currently lacks security measures.**

!!! danger "Attention"
    **To safeguard your Personal Zoo instance, it is highly recommended to ensure it is only accessible within your local network!**

I have plans to introduce several security features in the future development of this application. However, I cannot provide an exact timeline for their implementation as my availability is limited. As of now, these features are not essential for my personal setup since my Personal Zoo instance is solely accessible within my local network.

## Planned Security Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Session management
- Access control and permissions
- Automated testing to include Python module updates

Your understanding and patience are appreciated as I work towards making Personal Zoo a more secure and robust application. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to keep your instance restricted to your local network to minimize potential risks.
