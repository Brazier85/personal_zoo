To make it short.. at the current time there are **no security** features implemented into Personal Zoo.

**I know, that this is not the best answer - but it is te only right answer.**

!!! danger "Attention"
    **I highly recommend you to make sure your Personal Zoo instance is only reachable from your local network!**

I have planned some security features for the future of this application. But I do not know when I will have time to take care of those features. At the current time I do not need them for my personal setup because my Personal Zoo instance is only available to my local network.

## Planned features

- Add user authentication and authorization
- Sessions
- Access rights
- Automated testing
    - Including python module updates
