# Accessing Your Hosted Instance Securely

To access your hosted instance securely, you will receive an email containing your personalized link. We take your data security seriously, and that's why we implement Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt the connection between your device and our server. This ensures that your data remains confidential during transmission and provides an additional layer of protection for your Personal Zoo instance. 

However, please keep in mind that the URL of your instance is publicly visible. Therefore, exercise caution and avoid sharing it with unauthorized individuals to maintain the security and privacy of your Personal Zoo data.

## First Access

When you first access your instance, please note that the first account you register will automatically be designated as an administrator user. This provides you with administrative privileges to configure and manage your Personal Zoo instance.
