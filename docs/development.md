# How it is made

Personal Zoo is built using Python3 with Flask as the Web Framework, while the documentation is created with MkDocs and styled with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){:target="_blank"}.

## Project Structure

The foundation of the application consists of `main.py` and `functions.py`, with additional features located in the `blueprint` folder.

## Contribution

You are welcome to contribute to the development of the application or this documentation. Simply create a fork, make your desired changes, and submit a merge request.
