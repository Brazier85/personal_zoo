# How it is made

Personal Zoo is based on Python3 with Flask as Web-Framework. For the documentation I use MkDocs with Material for MkDocs.

## Structure

The base functions are split into `main.py` and `functions.py`. The rest of the features can be found in the `blueprint`-folder.

If you want to contribute on the application or this documentation feel free to make a fork and push your changes back via merge-request.

## Updates

I am working on this application in my spare time. So please do not expect frequent updates or new features all the time. If you stumble over a bug or two please let me know via the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/Brazier85/personal_zoo/issues){:target="_blank"}.
